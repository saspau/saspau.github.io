<p>Hey, Bojack. I haven't heard from you in like three months.<br>
Did I tell you I'm working on a blog?<br>
<strong>beep</strong></p>
<p>I don't know if you heard, but Mr. Peanutbutter is running for governor.<br>
I really wish you were here for this.<br>
<strong>beep</strong></p>
<p>Also, I haven't seen Todd in a while.<br>
He's not with you, is he?beepThis is Diane, by the way. Nguyen. Obviously.<br>
<strong>beep</strong></p>
<p>It's funny, the last time I saw you, you told me that you needed me in your life.<br>
And then you just disappeared.Anyway, things are even crazier around here lately.<br>
<strong>beep</strong></p>
<p>I'm sure you'd say something like, &quot;That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.&quot;<br>
<strong>beep</strong></p>
<p>Then you would so be so overwhelmed by the unbearable ludicrousness of the situation that you would get in your car and drive to hawaii. Wherever you are, I hope you're happy. I really do, Bojack.<br>
beep</p>
<p>The mailbox is full. Goodbye.</p>
