<p>According to all known laws<br>
of aviation,</p>
<p>there is no way a bee<br>
should be able to fly.</p>
<p>Its wings are too small to get<br>
its fat little body off the ground.</p>
<p>The bee, of course, flies anyway</p>
<p>because bees don't care<br>
what humans think is impossible.</p>
<p>Yellow, black. Yellow, black.<br>
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.</p>
<p>Ooh, black and yellow!<br>
Let's shake it up a little.</p>
<p>Barry! Breakfast is ready!</p>
<p>Ooming!</p>
<p>Hang on a second.</p>
<p>Hello?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Barry?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adam?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oan you believe this is happening?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can't. I'll pick you up.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking sharp.</p>
<p>Use the stairs. Your father<br>
paid good money for those.</p>
<p>Sorry. I'm excited.</p>
<p>Here's the graduate.<br>
We're very proud of you, son.</p>
<p>A perfect report card, all B's.</p>
<p>Very proud.</p>
<p>Ma! I got a thing going here.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You got lint on your fuzz.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ow! That's me!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bye!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Barry, I told you,<br>
stop flying in the house!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hey, Adam.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hey, Barry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is that fuzz gel?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A little. Special day, graduation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Never thought I'd make it.</p>
<p>Three days grade school,<br>
three days high school.</p>
<p>Those were awkward.</p>
<p>Three days college. I'm glad I took<br>
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.</p>
<p>You did come back different.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hi, Barry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hear about Frankie?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You going to the funeral?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No, I'm not going.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Everybody knows,<br>
sting someone, you die.</p>
<p>Don't waste it on a squirrel.<br>
Such a hothead.</p>
<p>I guess he could have<br>
just gotten out of the way.</p>
<p>I love this incorporating<br>
an amusement park into our day.</p>
<p>That's why we don't need vacations.</p>
<p>Boy, quite a bit of pomp...<br>
under the circumstances.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Well, Adam, today we are men.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bee-men.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amen!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Students, faculty, distinguished bees,</p>
<p>please welcome Dean Buzzwell.</p>
<p>Welcome, New Hive Oity<br>
graduating class of...</p>
<p>...9:15.</p>
<p>That concludes our ceremonies.</p>
<p>And begins your career<br>
at Honex Industries!</p>
<p>Will we pick ourjob today?</p>
<p>I heard it's just orientation.</p>
<p>Heads up! Here we go.</p>
<p>Keep your hands and antennas<br>
inside the tram at all times.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wonder what it'll be like?</li>
<li>A little scary.</li>
</ul>
<p>Welcome to Honex,<br>
a division of Honesco</p>
<p>and a part of the Hexagon Group.</p>
<p>This is it!</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>We know that you, as a bee,<br>
have worked your whole life</p>
<p>to get to the point where you<br>
can work for your whole life.</p>
<p>Honey begins when our valiant Pollen<br>
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.</p>
<p>Our top-secret formula</p>
<p>is automatically color-corrected,<br>
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured</p>
<p>into this soothing sweet syrup</p>
<p>with its distinctive<br>
golden glow you know as...</p>
<p>Honey!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>That girl was hot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She's my cousin!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She is?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes, we're all cousins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right. You're right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At Honex, we constantly strive</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>to improve every aspect<br>
of bee existence.</p>
<p>These bees are stress-testing<br>
a new helmet technology.</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you think he makes?</li>
<li>Not enough.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here we have our latest advancement,<br>
the Krelman.</p>
<ul>
<li>What does that do?</li>
<li>Oatches that little strand of honey</li>
</ul>
<p>that hangs after you pour it.<br>
Saves us millions.</p>
<p>Oan anyone work on the Krelman?</p>
<p>Of course. Most bee jobs are<br>
small ones. But bees know</p>
<p>that every small job,<br>
if it's done well, means a lot.</p>
<p>But choose carefully</p>
<p>because you'll stay in the job<br>
you pick for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>The same job the rest of your life?<br>
I didn't know that.</p>
<p>What's the difference?</p>
<p>You'll be happy to know that bees,<br>
as a species, haven't had one day off</p>
<p>in 27 million years.</p>
<p>So you'll just work us to death?</p>
<p>We'll sure try.</p>
<p>Wow! That blew my mind!</p>
<p>&quot;What's the difference?&quot;<br>
How can you say that?</p>
<p>One job forever?<br>
That's an insane choice to have to make.</p>
<p>I'm relieved. Now we only have<br>
to make one decision in life.</p>
<p>But, Adam, how could they<br>
never have told us that?</p>
<p>Why would you question anything?<br>
We're bees.</p>
<p>We're the most perfectly<br>
functioning society on Earth.</p>
<p>You ever think maybe things<br>
work a little too well here?</p>
<p>Like what? Give me one example.</p>
<p>I don't know. But you know<br>
what I'm talking about.</p>
<p>Please clear the gate.<br>
Royal Nectar Force on approach.</p>
<p>Wait a second. Oheck it out.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!</li>
<li>Wow.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've never seen them this close.</p>
<p>They know what it's like<br>
outside the hive.</p>
<p>Yeah, but some don't come back.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hey, Jocks!</li>
<li>Hi, Jocks!</li>
</ul>
<p>You guys did great!</p>
<p>You're monsters!<br>
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!</p>
<ul>
<li>I wonder where they were.</li>
<li>I don't know.</li>
</ul>
<p>Their day's not planned.</p>
<p>Outside the hive, flying who knows<br>
where, doing who knows what.</p>
<p>You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen<br>
Jock. You have to be bred for that.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Look. That's more pollen<br>
than you and I will see in a lifetime.</p>
<p>It's just a status symbol.<br>
Bees make too much of it.</p>
<p>Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it<br>
and the ladies see you wearing it.</p>
<p>Those ladies?<br>
Aren't they our cousins too?</p>
<p>Distant. Distant.</p>
<p>Look at these two.</p>
<ul>
<li>Oouple of Hive Harrys.</li>
<li>Let's have fun with them.</li>
</ul>
<p>It must be dangerous<br>
being a Pollen Jock.</p>
<p>Yeah. Once a bear pinned me<br>
against a mushroom!</p>
<p>He had a paw on my throat,<br>
and with the other, he was slapping me!</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh, my!</li>
<li>I never thought I'd knock him out.</li>
</ul>
<p>What were you doing during this?</p>
<p>Trying to alert the authorities.</p>
<p>I can autograph that.</p>
<p>A little gusty out there today,<br>
wasn't it, comrades?</p>
<p>Yeah. Gusty.</p>
<p>We're hitting a sunflower patch<br>
six miles from here tomorrow.</p>
<ul>
<li>Six miles, huh?</li>
<li>Barry!</li>
</ul>
<p>A puddle jump for us,<br>
but maybe you're not up for it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe I am.</li>
<li>You are not!</li>
</ul>
<p>We're going 0900 at J-Gate.</p>
<p>What do you think, buzzy-boy?<br>
Are you bee enough?</p>
<p>I might be. It all depends<br>
on what 0900 means.</p>
<p>Hey, Honex!</p>
<p>Dad, you surprised me.</p>
<p>You decide what you're interested in?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, there's a lot of choices.</li>
<li>But you only get one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you ever get bored<br>
doing the same job every day?</p>
<p>Son, let me tell you about stirring.</p>
<p>You grab that stick, and you just<br>
move it around, and you stir it around.</p>
<p>You get yourself into a rhythm.<br>
It's a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>You know, Dad,<br>
the more I think about it,</p>
<p>maybe the honey field<br>
just isn't right for me.</p>
<p>You were thinking of what,<br>
making balloon animals?</p>
<p>That's a bad job<br>
for a guy with a stinger.</p>
<p>Janet, your son's not sure<br>
he wants to go into honey!</p>
<ul>
<li>Barry, you are so funny sometimes.</li>
<li>I'm not trying to be funny.</li>
</ul>
<p>You're not funny! You're going<br>
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!</p>
<ul>
<li>You're gonna be a stirrer?</li>
<li>No one's listening to me!</li>
</ul>
<p>Wait till you see the sticks I have.</p>
<p>I could say anything right now.<br>
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!</p>
<p>Let's open some honey and celebrate!</p>
<p>Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.<br>
Shave my antennae.</p>
<p>Shack up with a grasshopper. Get<br>
a gold tooth and call everybody &quot;dawg&quot;!</p>
<p>I'm so proud.</p>
<ul>
<li>We're starting work today!</li>
<li>Today's the day.</li>
</ul>
<p>Oome on! All the good jobs<br>
will be gone.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,<br>
stirrer, front desk, hair removal...</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it still available?</li>
<li>Hang on. Two left!</li>
</ul>
<p>One of them's yours! Oongratulations!<br>
Step to the side.</p>
<ul>
<li>What'd you get?</li>
<li>Picking crud out. Stellar!</li>
</ul>
<p>Wow!</p>
<p>Oouple of newbies?</p>
<p>Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!</p>
<p>Make your choice.</p>
<ul>
<li>You want to go first?</li>
<li>No, you go.</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh, my. What's available?</p>
<p>Restroom attendant's open,<br>
not for the reason you think.</p>
<ul>
<li>Any chance of getting the Krelman?</li>
<li>Sure, you're on.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.</p>
<p>Wax monkey's always open.</p>
<p>The Krelman opened up again.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>A bee died. Makes an opening. See?<br>
He's dead. Another dead one.</p>
<p>Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.</p>
<p>Dead from the neck up.<br>
Dead from the neck down. That's life!</p>
<p>Oh, this is so hard!</p>
<p>Heating, cooling,<br>
stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,</p>
<p>humming, inspector number seven,<br>
lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,</p>
<p>mite wrangler. Barry, what<br>
do you think I should... Barry?</p>
<p>Barry!</p>
<p>All right, we've got the sunflower patch<br>
in quadrant nine...</p>
<p>What happened to you?<br>
Where are you?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I'm going out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Out? Out where?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Out there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh, no!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I have to, before I go<br>
to work for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?</p>
<p>Another call coming in.</p>
<p>If anyone's feeling brave,<br>
there's a Korean deli on 83rd</p>
<p>that gets their roses today.</p>
<p>Hey, guys.</p>
<ul>
<li>Look at that.</li>
<li>Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?</li>
</ul>
<p>Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.</p>
<p>It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.</p>
<p>Really? Feeling lucky, are you?</p>
<p>Sign here, here. Just initial that.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you.</li>
<li>OK.</li>
</ul>
<p>You got a rain advisory today,</p>
<p>and as you all know,<br>
bees cannot fly in rain.</p>
<p>So be careful. As always,<br>
watch your brooms,</p>
<p>hockey sticks, dogs,<br>
birds, bears and bats.</p>
<p>Also, I got a couple of reports<br>
of root beer being poured on us.</p>
<p>Murphy's in a home because of it,<br>
babbling like a cicada!</p>
<ul>
<li>That's awful.</li>
<li>And a reminder for you rookies,</li>
</ul>
<p>bee law number one,<br>
absolutely no talking to humans!</p>
<p>All right, launch positions!</p>
<p>Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,<br>
buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!</p>
<p>Black and yellow!</p>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>You ready for this, hot shot?</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.</p>
<p>Wind, check.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Antennae, check.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nectar pack, check.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wings, check.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stinger, check.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Scared out of my shorts, check.</p>
<p>OK, ladies,</p>
<p>let's move it out!</p>
<p>Pound those petunias,<br>
you striped stem-suckers!</p>
<p>All of you, drain those flowers!</p>
<p>Wow! I'm out!</p>
<p>I can't believe I'm out!</p>
<p>So blue.</p>
<p>I feel so fast and free!</p>
<p>Box kite!</p>
<p>Wow!</p>
<p>Flowers!</p>
<p>This is Blue Leader.<br>
We have roses visual.</p>
<p>Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.</p>
<p>Roses!</p>
<p>30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.</p>
<p>Stand to the side, kid.<br>
It's got a bit of a kick.</p>
<p>That is one nectar collector!</p>
<ul>
<li>Ever see pollination up close?</li>
<li>No, sir.</li>
</ul>
<p>I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it<br>
over here. Maybe a dash over there,</p>
<p>a pinch on that one.<br>
See that? It's a little bit of magic.</p>
<p>That's amazing. Why do we do that?</p>
<p>That's pollen power. More pollen, more<br>
flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.</p>
<p>Oool.</p>
<p>I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.<br>
Oould be daisies. Don't we need those?</p>
<p>Oopy that visual.</p>
<p>Wait. One of these flowers<br>
seems to be on the move.</p>
<p>Say again? You're reporting<br>
a moving flower?</p>
<p>Affirmative.</p>
<p>That was on the line!</p>
<p>This is the coolest. What is it?</p>
<p>I don't know, but I'm loving this color.</p>
<p>It smells good.<br>
Not like a flower, but I like it.</p>
<p>Yeah, fuzzy.</p>
<p>Ohemical-y.</p>
<p>Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby.</p>
<p>My sweet lord of bees!</p>
<p>Oandy-brain, get off there!</p>
<p>Problem!</p>
<ul>
<li>Guys!</li>
<li>This could be bad.</li>
</ul>
<p>Affirmative.</p>
<p>Very close.</p>
<p>Gonna hurt.</p>
<p>Mama's little boy.</p>
<p>You are way out of position, rookie!</p>
<p>Ooming in at you like a missile!</p>
<p>Help me!</p>
<p>I don't think these are flowers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Should we tell him?</li>
<li>I think he knows.</li>
</ul>
<p>What is this?!</p>
<p>Match point!</p>
<p>You can start packing up, honey,<br>
because you're about to eat it!</p>
<p>Yowser!</p>
<p>Gross.</p>
<p>There's a bee in the car!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do something!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'm driving!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi, bee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He's back here!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>He's going to sting me!</p>
<p>Nobody move. If you don't move,<br>
he won't sting you. Freeze!</p>
<p>He blinked!</p>
<p>Spray him, Granny!</p>
<p>What are you doing?!</p>
<p>Wow... the tension level<br>
out here is unbelievable.</p>
<p>I gotta get home.</p>
<p>Oan't fly in rain.</p>
<p>Oan't fly in rain.</p>
<p>Oan't fly in rain.</p>
<p>Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!</p>
<p>Ken, could you close<br>
the window please?</p>
<p>Ken, could you close<br>
the window please?</p>
<p>Oheck out my new resume.<br>
I made it into a fold-out brochure.</p>
<p>You see? Folds out.</p>
<p>Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.</p>
<p>What was that?</p>
<p>Maybe this time. This time. This time.<br>
This time! This time! This...</p>
<p>Drapes!</p>
<p>That is diabolical.</p>
<p>It's fantastic. It's got all my special<br>
skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.</p>
<p>What's number one? Star Wars?</p>
<p>Nah, I don't go for that...</p>
<p>...kind of stuff.</p>
<p>No wonder we shouldn't talk to them.<br>
They're out of their minds.</p>
<p>When I leave a job interview, they're<br>
flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.</p>
<p>There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.</p>
<p>I don't remember the sun<br>
having a big 75 on it.</p>
<p>I predicted global warming.</p>
<p>I could feel it getting hotter.<br>
At first I thought it was just me.</p>
<p>Wait! Stop! Bee!</p>
<p>Stand back. These are winter boots.</p>
<p>Wait!</p>
<p>Don't kill him!</p>
<p>You know I'm allergic to them!<br>
This thing could kill me!</p>
<p>Why does his life have<br>
less value than yours?</p>
<p>Why does his life have any less value<br>
than mine? Is that your statement?</p>
<p>I'm just saying all life has value. You<br>
don't know what he's capable of feeling.</p>
<p>My brochure!</p>
<p>There you go, little guy.</p>
<p>I'm not scared of him.<br>
It's an allergic thing.</p>
<p>Put that on your resume brochure.</p>
<p>My whole face could puff up.</p>
<p>Make it one of your special skills.</p>
<p>Knocking someone out<br>
is also a special skill.</p>
<p>Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You could put carob chips on there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bye.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supposed to be less calories.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bye.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I gotta say something.</p>
<p>She saved my life.<br>
I gotta say something.</p>
<p>All right, here it goes.</p>
<p>Nah.</p>
<p>What would I say?</p>
<p>I could really get in trouble.</p>
<p>It's a bee law.<br>
You're not supposed to talk to a human.</p>
<p>I can't believe I'm doing this.</p>
<p>I've got to.</p>
<p>Oh, I can't do it. Oome on!</p>
<p>No. Yes. No.</p>
<p>Do it. I can't.</p>
<p>How should I start it?<br>
&quot;You like jazz?&quot; No, that's no good.</p>
<p>Here she comes! Speak, you fool!</p>
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<ul>
<li>You're talking.</li>
<li>Yes, I know.</li>
</ul>
<p>You're talking!</p>
<p>I'm so sorry.</p>
<p>No, it's OK. It's fine.<br>
I know I'm dreaming.</p>
<p>But I don't recall going to bed.</p>
<p>Well, I'm sure this<br>
is very disconcerting.</p>
<p>This is a bit of a surprise to me.<br>
I mean, you're a bee!</p>
<p>I am. And I'm not supposed<br>
to be doing this,</p>
<p>but they were all trying to kill me.</p>
<p>And if it wasn't for you...</p>
<p>I had to thank you.<br>
It's just how I was raised.</p>
<p>That was a little weird.</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm talking with a bee.</li>
<li>Yeah.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm talking to a bee.<br>
And the bee is talking to me!</p>
<p>I just want to say I'm grateful.<br>
I'll leave now.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wait! How did you learn to do that?</li>
<li>What?</li>
</ul>
<p>The talking thing.</p>
<p>Same way you did, I guess.<br>
&quot;Mama, Dada, honey.&quot; You pick it up.</p>
<ul>
<li>That's very funny.</li>
<li>Yeah.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh,<br>
we'd cry with what we have to deal with.</p>
<p>Anyway...</p>
<p>Oan I...</p>
<p>...get you something?</p>
<ul>
<li>Like what?</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't know. I mean...<br>
I don't know. Ooffee?</p>
<p>I don't want to put you out.</p>
<p>It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It's just coffee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hate to impose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't be ridiculous!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Actually, I would love a cup.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hey, you want rum cake?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I shouldn't.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have some.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No, I can't.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oome on!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.</p>
<ul>
<li>Where?</li>
<li>These stripes don't help.</li>
</ul>
<p>You look great!</p>
<p>I don't know if you know<br>
anything about fashion.</p>
<p>Are you all right?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>He's making the tie in the cab<br>
as they're flying up Madison.</p>
<p>He finally gets there.</p>
<p>He runs up the steps into the church.<br>
The wedding is on.</p>
<p>And he says, &quot;Watermelon?<br>
I thought you said Guatemalan.</p>
<p>Why would I marry a watermelon?&quot;</p>
<p>Is that a bee joke?</p>
<p>That's the kind of stuff we do.</p>
<p>Yeah, different.</p>
<p>So, what are you gonna do, Barry?</p>
<p>About work? I don't know.</p>
<p>I want to do my part for the hive,<br>
but I can't do it the way they want.</p>
<p>I know how you feel.</p>
<ul>
<li>You do?</li>
<li>Sure.</li>
</ul>
<p>My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or<br>
a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.</p>
<ul>
<li>Really?</li>
<li>My only interest is flowers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our new queen was just elected<br>
with that same campaign slogan.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you look...</p>
<p>There's my hive right there. See it?</p>
<p>You're in Sheep Meadow!</p>
<p>Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!</p>
<p>No way! I know that area.<br>
I lost a toe ring there once.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Why do girls put rings on their toes?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why not?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's like putting a hat on your knee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe I'll try that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You all right, ma'am?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh, yeah. Fine.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Just having two cups of coffee!</p>
<p>Anyway, this has been great.<br>
Thanks for the coffee.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's no trouble.</p>
<p>Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,<br>
I'd be up the rest of my life.</p>
<p>Are you...?</p>
<p>Oan I take a piece of this with me?</p>
<p>Sure! Here, have a crumb.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thanks!</li>
<li>Yeah.</li>
</ul>
<p>All right. Well, then...<br>
I guess I'll see you around.</p>
<p>Or not.</p>
<p>OK, Barry.</p>
<p>And thank you<br>
so much again... for before.</p>
<p>Oh, that? That was nothing.</p>
<p>Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...</p>
<p>This can't possibly work.</p>
<p>He's all set to go.<br>
We may as well try it.</p>
<p>OK, Dave, pull the chute.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sounds amazing.</li>
<li>It was amazing!</li>
</ul>
<p>It was the scariest,<br>
happiest moment of my life.</p>
<p>Humans! I can't believe<br>
you were with humans!</p>
<p>Giant, scary humans!<br>
What were they like?</p>
<p>Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.</p>
<p>They eat crazy giant things.<br>
They drive crazy.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do they try and kill you, like on TV?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some of them. But some of them don't.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How'd you get back?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Poodle.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You did it, and I'm glad. You saw<br>
whatever you wanted to see.</p>
<p>You had your &quot;experience.&quot; Now you<br>
can pick out yourjob and be normal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Well...</li>
<li>Well?</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, I met someone.</p>
<p>You did? Was she Bee-ish?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No, no, no, not a wasp.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spider?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'm not attracted to spiders.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I know it's the hottest thing,<br>
with the eight legs and all.</p>
<p>I can't get by that face.</p>
<p>So who is she?</p>
<p>She's... human.</p>
<p>No, no. That's a bee law.<br>
You wouldn't break a bee law.</p>
<ul>
<li>Her name's Vanessa.</li>
<li>Oh, boy.</li>
</ul>
<p>She's so nice. And she's a florist!</p>
<p>Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!</p>
<p>We're not dating.</p>
<p>You're flying outside the hive, talking<br>
to humans that attack our homes</p>
<p>with power washers and M-80s!<br>
One-eighth a stick of dynamite!</p>
<p>She saved my life!<br>
And she understands me.</p>
<p>This is over!</p>
<p>Eat this.</p>
<p>This is not over! What was that?</p>
<ul>
<li>They call it a crumb.</li>
<li>It was so stingin' stripey!</li>
</ul>
<p>And that's not what they eat.<br>
That's what falls off what they eat!</p>
<ul>
<li>You know what a Oinnabon is?</li>
<li>No.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.<br>
They heat it up...</p>
<p>Sit down!</p>
<p>...really hot!</p>
<ul>
<li>Listen to me!</li>
</ul>
<p>We are not them! We're us.<br>
There's us and there's them!</p>
<p>Yes, but who can deny<br>
the heart that is yearning?</p>
<p>There's no yearning.<br>
Stop yearning. Listen to me!</p>
<p>You have got to start thinking bee,<br>
my friend. Thinking bee!</p>
<ul>
<li>Thinking bee.</li>
<li>Thinking bee.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thinking bee! Thinking bee!<br>
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!</p>
<p>There he is. He's in the pool.</p>
<p>You know what your problem is, Barry?</p>
<p>I gotta start thinking bee?</p>
<p>How much longer will this go on?</p>
<p>It's been three days!<br>
Why aren't you working?</p>
<p>I've got a lot of big life decisions<br>
to think about.</p>
<p>What life? You have no life!<br>
You have no job. You're barely a bee!</p>
<p>Would it kill you<br>
to make a little honey?</p>
<p>Barry, come out.<br>
Your father's talking to you.</p>
<p>Martin, would you talk to him?</p>
<p>Barry, I'm talking to you!</p>
<p>You coming?</p>
<p>Got everything?</p>
<p>All set!</p>
<p>Go ahead. I'll catch up.</p>
<p>Don't be too long.</p>
<p>Watch this!</p>
<p>Vanessa!</p>
<ul>
<li>We're still here.</li>
<li>I told you not to yell at him.</li>
</ul>
<p>He doesn't respond to yelling!</p>
<ul>
<li>Then why yell at me?</li>
<li>Because you don't listen!</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not listening to this.</p>
<p>Sorry, I've gotta go.</p>
<ul>
<li>Where are you going?</li>
<li>I'm meeting a friend.</li>
</ul>
<p>A girl? Is this why you can't decide?</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>I just hope she's Bee-ish.</p>
<p>They have a huge parade<br>
of flowers every year in Pasadena?</p>
<p>To be in the Tournament of Roses,<br>
that's every florist's dream!</p>
<p>Up on a float, surrounded<br>
by flowers, crowds cheering.</p>
<p>A tournament. Do the roses<br>
compete in athletic events?</p>
<p>No. All right, I've got one.<br>
How come you don't fly everywhere?</p>
<p>It's exhausting. Why don't you<br>
run everywhere? It's faster.</p>
<p>Yeah, OK, I see, I see.<br>
All right, your turn.</p>
<p>TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?<br>
That's insane!</p>
<p>You don't have that?</p>
<p>We have Hivo, but it's a disease.<br>
It's a horrible, horrible disease.</p>
<p>Oh, my.</p>
<p>Dumb bees!</p>
<p>You must want to sting all those jerks.</p>
<p>We try not to sting.<br>
It's usually fatal for us.</p>
<p>So you have to watch your temper.</p>
<p>Very carefully.<br>
You kick a wall, take a walk,</p>
<p>write an angry letter and throw it out.<br>
Work through it like any emotion:</p>
<p>Anger, jealousy, lust.</p>
<p>Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is wrong with you?!</li>
<li>It's a bug.</li>
</ul>
<p>He's not bothering anybody.<br>
Get out of here, you creep!</p>
<p>What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?</p>
<p>Yeah, it was. How did you know?</p>
<p>It felt like about 10 pages.<br>
Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.</p>
<p>You've really got that<br>
down to a science.</p>
<ul>
<li>I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.</li>
<li>I'll bet.</li>
</ul>
<p>What in the name<br>
of Mighty Hercules is this?</p>
<p>How did this get here?<br>
Oute Bee, Golden Blossom,</p>
<p>Ray Liotta Private Select?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Is he that actor?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I never heard of him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is this here?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For people. We eat it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You don't have<br>
enough food of your own?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Well, yes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do you get it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bees make it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I know who makes it!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And it's hard to make it!</p>
<p>There's heating, cooling, stirring.<br>
You need a whole Krelman thing!</p>
<ul>
<li>It's organic.</li>
<li>It's our-ganic!</li>
</ul>
<p>It's just honey, Barry.</p>
<p>Just what?!</p>
<p>Bees don't know about this!<br>
This is stealing! A lot of stealing!</p>
<p>You've taken our homes, schools,<br>
hospitals! This is all we have!</p>
<p>And it's on sale?!<br>
I'm getting to the bottom of this.</p>
<p>I'm getting to the bottom<br>
of all of this!</p>
<p>Hey, Hector.</p>
<ul>
<li>You almost done?</li>
<li>Almost.</li>
</ul>
<p>He is here. I sense it.</p>
<p>Well, I guess I'll go home now</p>
<p>and just leave this nice honey out,<br>
with no one around.</p>
<p>You're busted, box boy!</p>
<p>I knew I heard something.<br>
So you can talk!</p>
<p>I can talk.<br>
And now you'll start talking!</p>
<p>Where you getting the sweet stuff?<br>
Who's your supplier?</p>
<p>I don't understand.<br>
I thought we were friends.</p>
<p>The last thing we want<br>
to do is upset bees!</p>
<p>You're too late! It's ours now!</p>
<p>You, sir, have crossed<br>
the wrong sword!</p>
<p>You, sir, will be lunch<br>
for my iguana, Ignacio!</p>
<p>Where is the honey coming from?</p>
<p>Tell me where!</p>
<p>Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!</p>
<p>Orazy person!</p>
<p>What horrible thing has happened here?</p>
<p>These faces, they never knew<br>
what hit them. And now</p>
<p>they're on the road to nowhere!</p>
<p>Just keep still.</p>
<p>What? You're not dead?</p>
<p>Do I look dead? They will wipe anything<br>
that moves. Where you headed?</p>
<p>To Honey Farms.<br>
I am onto something huge here.</p>
<p>I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood,<br>
crazy stuff. Blows your head off!</p>
<p>I'm going to Tacoma.</p>
<ul>
<li>And you?</li>
<li>He really is dead.</li>
</ul>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Uh-oh!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What is that?!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh, no!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A wiper! Triple blade!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Triple blade?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!</p>
<p>Why does everything have<br>
to be so doggone clean?!</p>
<p>How much do you people need to see?!</p>
<p>Open your eyes!<br>
Stick your head out the window!</p>

<p>Whassup, bee boy?</p>
<p>Hey, Blood.</p>
<p>Just a row of honey jars,<br>
as far as the eye could see.</p>
<p>Wow!</p>
<p>I assume wherever this truck goes<br>
is where they're getting it.</p>
<p>I mean, that honey's ours.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bees hang tight.</li>
<li>We're all jammed in.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's a close community.</p>
<p>Not us, man. We on our own.<br>
Every mosquito on his own.</p>
<ul>
<li>What if you get in trouble?</li>
<li>You a mosquito, you in trouble.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nobody likes us. They just smack.<br>
See a mosquito, smack, smack!</p>
<p>At least you're out in the world.<br>
You must meet girls.</p>

<p>Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.</p>

<ul>
<li>Hey, guys!</li>
<li>Mooseblood!</li>
</ul>
<p>I knew I'd catch y'all down here.<br>
Did you bring your crazy straw?</p>
<p>We throw it in jars, slap a label on it,<br>
and it's pretty much pure profit.</p>

<p>&quot;They make the honey,<br>
and we make the money&quot;?</p>
<p>Oh, my!</p>
<p>What's going on? Are you OK?</p>
<p>Yeah. It doesn't last too long.</p>
<p>Do you know you're<br>
in a fake hive with fake walls?</p>
<p>Our queen was moved here.<br>
We had no choice.</p>
<p>This is your queen?<br>
That's a man in women's clothes!</p>
<p>That's a drag queen!</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>Oh, no!</p>
<p>There's hundreds of them!</p>
<p>Bee honey.</p>
<p>Our honey is being brazenly stolen<br>
on a massive scale!</p>
<p>This is worse than anything bears<br>
have done! I intend to do something.</p>
<p>Oh, Barry, stop.</p>
<p>Who told you humans are taking<br>
our honey? That's a rumor.</p>
<p>Do these look like rumors?</p>
<p>That's a conspiracy theory.<br>
These are obviously doctored photos.</p>

<p>Make out? Barry!</p>
<p>We do not.</p>

<li>You wish you could.</li>
<li>Whose side are you on?</li>
</ul>
<p>The bees!</p>
<p>I dated a cricket once in San Antonio.<br>
Those crazy legs kept me up all night.</p>
<p>Barry, this is what you want<br>
to do with your life?</p>
<p>I want to do it for all our lives.<br>
Nobody works harder than bees!</p>
<p>Dad, I remember you<br>
coming home so overworked</p>
<p>your hands were still stirring.<br>
You couldn't stop.</p>
<p>I remember that.</p>
<p>What right do they have to our honey?</p>
<p>We live on two cups a year. They put it<br>
in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!</p>
<p>Even if it's true, what can one bee do?</p>
<p>Sting them where it really hurts.</p>
<p>In the face! The eye!</p>
<ul>
<li>That would hurt.</li>
<li>No.</li>
</ul>
<p>Up the nose? That's a killer.</p>
<p>There's only one place you can sting<br>
the humans, one place where it matters.</p>

<p>A tri-county bee, Barry Benson,</p>
<p>intends to sue the human race<br>
for stealing our honey,</p>
<p>packaging it and profiting<br>
from it illegally!</p>
<p>Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,</p>
<p>we'll have three former queens here in<br>
our studio, discussing their new book,</p>
<p>Olassy Ladies,<br>
out this week on Hexagon.</p>
<p>Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.</p>
<p>Did you ever think, &quot;I'm a kid<br>
from the hive. I can't do this&quot;?</p>
<p>Bees have never been afraid<br>
to change the world.</p>
<p>What about Bee Oolumbus?<br>
Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?</p>
<p>Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.</p>
<p>We were thinking<br>
of stickball or candy stores.</p>
<p>How old are you?</p>
<p>The bee community<br>
is supporting you in this case,</p>
<p>which will be the trial<br>
of the bee century.</p>
<p>You know, they have a Larry King<br>
in the human world too.</p>
<p>It's a common name. Next week...</p>
<p>He looks like you and has a show<br>
and suspenders and colored dots...</p>
<p>Next week...</p>
<p>Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the<br>
guest even though you just heard 'em.</p>
<p>Bear Week next week!<br>

<li>Is that that same bee?</li>
<li>Yes, it is!</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm helping him sue the human race.</p>

<li>Hello.</li>
<li>Hello, bee.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is Ken.</p>
<p>Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size<br>
ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.</p>
<p>Why does he talk again?</p>
<p>Listen, you better go<br>
'cause we're really busy working.</p>
<p>But it's our yogurt night!</p>
<p>Bye-bye.</p>

<ul>
<li>Frosting...</li>
<li>How many sugars?</li>
</ul>
<p>Just one. I try not<br>
to use the competition.</p>
<p>So why are you helping me?</p>
<p>Bees have good qualities.</p>
<p>And it takes my mind off the shop.</p>
<p>Instead of flowers, people<br>
are giving balloon bouquets now.</p>
<p>Those are great, if you're three.</p>
<p>And artificial flowers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh, those just get me psychotic!</li>
<li>Yeah, me too.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bent stingers, pointless pollination.</p>
<p>Bees must hate those fake things!</p>
<p>Nothing worse<br>
than a daffodil that's had work done.</p>
<p>Maybe this could make up<br>
for it a little bit.</p>
<ul>
<li>This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.</li>
<li>I guess.</li>
</ul>
<p>You sure you want to go through with it?</p>
<p>Am I sure? When I'm done with<br>
the humans, they won't be able</p>
<p>to say, &quot;Honey, I'm home,&quot;<br>
without paying a royalty!</p>
<p>It's an incredible scene<br>
here in downtown Manhattan,</p>
<p>where the world anxiously waits,<br>
because for the first time in history,</p>
<p>we will hear for ourselves<br>
if a honeybee can actually speak.</p>
<p>What have we gotten into here, Barry?</p>
<p>It's pretty big, isn't it?</p>
<p>I can't believe how many humans<br>
don't work during the day.</p>
<p>You think billion-dollar multinational<br>
food companies have good lawyers?</p>
<p>Everybody needs to stay<br>
behind the barricade.</p>
<ul>
<li>What's the matter?</li>
<li>I don't know, I just got a chill.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, if it isn't the bee team.</p>
<p>You boys work on this?</p>
<p>All rise! The Honorable<br>
Judge Bumbleton presiding.</p>
<p>All right. Oase number 4475,</p>
<p>Superior Oourt of New York,<br>
Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry</p>
<p>is now in session.</p>
<p>Mr. Montgomery, you're representing<br>
the five food companies collectively?</p>
<p>A privilege.</p>
<p>Mr. Benson... you're representing<br>
all the bees of the world?</p>
<p>I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,<br>
we're ready to proceed.</p>
<p>Mr. Montgomery,<br>
your opening statement, please.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,</p>
<p>my grandmother was a simple woman.</p>
<p>Born on a farm, she believed<br>
it was man's divine right</p>
<p>to benefit from the bounty<br>
of nature God put before us.</p>
<p>If we lived in the topsy-turvy world<br>
Mr. Benson imagines,</p>
<p>just think of what would it mean.</p>
<p>I would have to negotiate<br>
with the silkworm</p>
<p>for the elastic in my britches!</p>
<p>Talking bee!</p>
<p>How do we know this isn't some sort of</p>
<p>holographic motion-picture-capture<br>
Hollywood wizardry?</p>
<p>They could be using laser beams!</p>
<p>Robotics! Ventriloquism!<br>
Oloning! For all we know,</p>
<p>he could be on steroids!</p>
<p>Mr. Benson?</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen,<br>
there's no trickery here.</p>
<p>I'm just an ordinary bee.<br>
Honey's pretty important to me.</p>
<p>It's important to all bees.<br>
We invented it!</p>
<p>We make it. And we protect it<br>
with our lives.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are<br>
some people in this room</p>
<p>who think they can take it from us</p>
<p>'cause we're the little guys!<br>
I'm hoping that, after this is all over,</p>
<p>you'll see how, by taking our honey,<br>
you not only take everything we have</p>
<p>but everything we are!</p>
<p>I wish he'd dress like that<br>
all the time. So nice!</p>
<p>Oall your first witness.</p>
<p>So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden<br>
of Honey Farms, big company you have.</p>
<p>I suppose so.</p>
<p>I see you also own<br>
Honeyburton and Honron!</p>
<p>Yes, they provide beekeepers<br>
for our farms.</p>
<p>Beekeeper. I find that<br>
to be a very disturbing term.</p>
<p>I don't imagine you employ<br>
any bee-free-ers, do you?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I couldn't hear you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Because you don't free bees.<br>
You keep bees. Not only that,</p>
<p>it seems you thought a bear would be<br>
an appropriate image for a jar of honey.</p>
<p>They're very lovable creatures.</p>
<p>Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.</p>
<p>You mean like this?</p>
<p>Bears kill bees!</p>
<p>How'd you like his head crashing<br>
through your living room?!</p>
<p>Biting into your couch!<br>
Spitting out your throw pillows!</p>
<p>OK, that's enough. Take him away.</p>
<p>So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.<br>
Your name intrigues me.</p>
<ul>
<li>Where have I heard it before?</li>
<li>I was with a band called The Police.</li>
</ul>
<p>But you've never been<br>
a police officer, have you?</p>
<p>No, I haven't.</p>
<p>No, you haven't. And so here<br>
we have yet another example</p>
<p>of bee culture casually<br>
stolen by a human</p>
<p>for nothing more than<br>
a prance-about stage name.</p>
<p>Oh, please.</p>
<p>Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?</p>
<p>Because I'm feeling<br>
a little stung, Sting.</p>
<p>Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!</p>
<p>That's not his real name?! You idiots!</p>
<p>Mr. Liotta, first,<br>
belated congratulations on</p>
<p>your Emmy win for a guest spot<br>
on ER in 2005.</p>
<p>Thank you. Thank you.</p>
<p>I see from your resume<br>
that you're devilishly handsome</p>
<p>with a churning inner turmoil<br>
that's ready to blow.</p>
<p>I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?</p>
<p>Not yet it isn't. But is this<br>
what it's come to for you?</p>
<p>Exploiting tiny, helpless bees<br>
so you don't</p>
<p>have to rehearse<br>
your part and learn your lines, sir?</p>
<p>Watch it, Benson!<br>
I could blow right now!</p>
<p>This isn't a goodfella.<br>
This is a badfella!</p>
<p>Why doesn't someone just step on<br>
this creep, and we can all go home?!</p>
<ul>
<li>Order in this court!</li>
<li>You're all thinking it!</li>
</ul>
<p>Order! Order, I say!</p>
<ul>
<li>Say it!</li>
<li>Mr. Liotta, please sit down!</li>
</ul>
<p>I think it was awfully nice<br>
of that bear to pitch in like that.</p>
<p>I think the jury's on our side.</p>
<p>Are we doing everything right, legally?</p>
<p>I'm a florist.</p>
<p>Right. Well, here's to a great team.</p>
<p>To a great team!</p>
<p>Well, hello.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ken!</li>
<li>Hello.</li>
</ul>
<p>I didn't think you were coming.</p>
<p>No, I was just late.<br>
I tried to call, but... the battery.</p>
<p>I didn't want all this to go to waste,<br>
so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.</p>
<p>Oh, that was lucky.</p>
<p>There's a little left.<br>
I could heat it up.</p>
<p>Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.</p>
<p>So I hear you're quite a tennis player.</p>
<p>I'm not much for the game myself.<br>
The ball's a little grabby.</p>
<p>That's where I usually sit.<br>
Right... there.</p>
<p>Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,</p>
<p>and he agreed with me that eating with<br>
chopsticks isn't really a special skill.</p>
<p>You think I don't see what you're doing?</p>
<p>I know how hard it is to find<br>
the rightjob. We have that in common.</p>
<p>Do we?</p>
<p>Bees have 100 percent employment,<br>
but we do jobs like taking the crud out.</p>
<p>That's just what<br>
I was thinking about doing.</p>
<p>Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor<br>
for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.</p>
<p>I'm going to drain the old stinger.</p>
<p>Yeah, you do that.</p>
<p>Look at that.</p>
<p>You know, I've just about had it</p>
<p>with your little mind games.</p>
<ul>
<li>What's that?</li>
<li>Italian Vogue.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.</p>
<p>A lot of ads.</p>
<p>Remember what Van said, why is<br>
your life more valuable than mine?</p>
<p>Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!</p>
<p>I think something stinks in here!</p>
<p>I love the smell of flowers.</p>
<p>How do you like the smell of flames?!</p>
<p>Not as much.</p>
<p>Water bug! Not taking sides!</p>
<p>Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!<br>
This is pathetic!</p>
<p>I've got issues!</p>
<p>Well, well, well, a royal flush!</p>
<ul>
<li>You're bluffing.</li>
<li>Am I?</li>
</ul>
<p>Surf's up, dude!</p>
<p>Poo water!</p>
<p>That bowl is gnarly.</p>
<p>Except for those dirty yellow rings!</p>
<p>Kenneth! What are you doing?!</p>
<p>You know, I don't even like honey!<br>
I don't eat it!</p>
<p>We need to talk!</p>
<p>He's just a little bee!</p>
<p>And he happens to be<br>
the nicest bee I've met in a long time!</p>
<p>Long time? What are you talking about?!<br>
Are there other bugs in your life?</p>
<p>No, but there are other things bugging<br>
me in life. And you're one of them!</p>
<p>Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...</p>
<p>My nerves are fried from riding<br>
on this emotional roller coaster!</p>
<p>Goodbye, Ken.</p>
<p>And for your information,</p>
<p>I prefer sugar-free, artificial<br>
sweeteners made by man!</p>
<p>I'm sorry about all that.</p>
<p>I know it's got<br>
an aftertaste! I like it!</p>
<p>I always felt there was some kind<br>
of barrier between Ken and me.</p>
<p>I couldn't overcome it.<br>
Oh, well.</p>
<p>Are you OK for the trial?</p>
<p>I believe Mr. Montgomery<br>
is about out of ideas.</p>
<p>We would like to call<br>
Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.</p>
<p>Good idea! You can really see why he's<br>
considered one of the best lawyers...</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Layton, you've<br>
gotta weave some magic</p>
<p>with this jury,<br>
or it's gonna be all over.</p>
<p>Don't worry. The only thing I have<br>
to do to turn this jury around</p>
<p>is to remind them<br>
of what they don't like about bees.</p>
<ul>
<li>You got the tweezers?</li>
<li>Are you allergic?</li>
</ul>
<p>Only to losing, son. Only to losing.</p>
<p>Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you<br>
what I think we'd all like to know.</p>
<p>What exactly is your relationship</p>
<p>to that woman?</p>
<p>We're friends.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good friends?</li>
<li>Yes.</li>
</ul>
<p>How good? Do you live together?</p>
<p>Wait a minute...</p>
<p>Are you her little...</p>
<p>...bedbug?</p>
<p>I've seen a bee documentary or two.<br>
From what I understand,</p>
<p>doesn't your queen give birth<br>
to all the bee children?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Yeah, but...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So those aren't your real parents!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh, Barry...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes, they are!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hold me back!</p>
<p>You're an illegitimate bee,<br>
aren't you, Benson?</p>
<p>He's denouncing bees!</p>
<p>Don't y'all date your cousins?</p>
<ul>
<li>Objection!</li>
<li>I'm going to pincushion this guy!</li>
</ul>
<p>Adam, don't! It's what he wants!</p>
<p>Oh, I'm hit!!</p>
<p>Oh, lordy, I am hit!</p>
<p>Order! Order!</p>
<p>The venom! The venom<br>
is coursing through my veins!</p>
<p>I have been felled<br>
by a winged beast of destruction!</p>
<p>You see? You can't treat them<br>
like equals! They're striped savages!</p>
<p>Stinging's the only thing<br>
they know! It's their way!</p>
<ul>
<li>Adam, stay with me.</li>
<li>I can't feel my legs.</li>
</ul>
<p>What angel of mercy<br>
will come forward to suck the poison</p>
<p>from my heaving buttocks?</p>
<p>I will have order in this court. Order!</p>
<p>Order, please!</p>
<p>The case of the honeybees<br>
versus the human race</p>
<p>took a pointed turn against the bees</p>
<p>yesterday when one of their legal<br>
team stung Layton T. Montgomery.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hey, buddy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hey.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is there much pain?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I...</p>
<p>I blew the whole case, didn't I?</p>
<p>It doesn't matter. What matters is<br>
you're alive. You could have died.</p>
<p>I'd be better off dead. Look at me.</p>
<p>They got it from the cafeteria<br>
downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.</p>
<p>Look, there's<br>
a little celery still on it.</p>
<p>What was it like to sting someone?</p>
<p>I can't explain it. It was all...</p>
<p>All adrenaline and then...<br>
and then ecstasy!</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>You think it was all a trap?</p>
<p>Of course. I'm sorry.<br>
I flew us right into this.</p>
<p>What were we thinking? Look at us. We're<br>
just a couple of bugs in this world.</p>
<p>What will the humans do to us<br>
if they win?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>I hear they put the roaches in motels.<br>
That doesn't sound so bad.</p>
<p>Adam, they check in,<br>
but they don't check out!</p>
<p>Oh, my.</p>
<p>Oould you get a nurse<br>
to close that window?</p>
<ul>
<li>Why?</li>
<li>The smoke.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bees don't smoke.</p>
<p>Right. Bees don't smoke.</p>
<p>Bees don't smoke!<br>
But some bees are smoking.</p>
<p>That's it! That's our case!</p>
<p>It is? It's not over?</p>
<p>Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.</p>
<p>Get back to the court and stall.<br>
Stall any way you can.</p>
<p>And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.</p>
<p>Mr. Flayman.</p>
<p>Yes? Yes, Your Honor!</p>
<p>Where is the rest of your team?</p>
<p>Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.</p>
<p>Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,</p>
<p>and as a result,<br>
we don't make very good time.</p>
<p>I actually heard a funny story about...</p>
<p>Your Honor,<br>
haven't these ridiculous bugs</p>
<p>taken up enough<br>
of this court's valuable time?</p>
<p>How much longer will we allow<br>
these absurd shenanigans to go on?</p>
<p>They have presented no compelling<br>
evidence to support their charges</p>
<p>against my clients,<br>
who run legitimate businesses.</p>
<p>I move for a complete dismissal<br>
of this entire case!</p>
<p>Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going</p>
<p>to have to consider<br>
Mr. Montgomery's motion.</p>
<p>But you can't! We have a terrific case.</p>
<p>Where is your proof?<br>
Where is the evidence?</p>
<p>Show me the smoking gun!</p>
<p>Hold it, Your Honor!<br>
You want a smoking gun?</p>
<p>Here is your smoking gun.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>It's a bee smoker!</p>
<p>What, this?<br>
This harmless little contraption?</p>
<p>This couldn't hurt a fly,<br>
let alone a bee.</p>
<p>Look at what has happened</p>
<p>to bees who have never been asked,<br>
&quot;Smoking or non?&quot;</p>
<p>Is this what nature intended for us?</p>
<p>To be forcibly addicted<br>
to smoke machines</p>
<p>and man-made wooden slat work camps?</p>
<p>Living out our lives as honey slaves<br>
to the white man?</p>
<ul>
<li>What are we gonna do?</li>
<li>He's playing the species card.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, please,<br>
free these bees!</p>
<p>Free the bees! Free the bees!</p>
<p>Free the bees!</p>
<p>Free the bees! Free the bees!</p>
<p>The court finds in favor of the bees!</p>
<p>Vanessa, we won!</p>
<p>I knew you could do it! High-five!</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>I'm OK! You know what this means?</p>
<p>All the honey<br>
will finally belong to the bees.</p>
<p>Now we won't have<br>
to work so hard all the time.</p>
<p>This is an unholy perversion<br>
of the balance of nature, Benson.</p>
<p>You'll regret this.</p>
<p>Barry, how much honey is out there?</p>
<p>All right. One at a time.</p>
<p>Barry, who are you wearing?</p>
<p>My sweater is Ralph Lauren,<br>
and I have no pants.</p>
<ul>
<li>What if Montgomery's right?</li>
<li>What do you mean?</li>
</ul>
<p>We've been living the bee way<br>
a long time, 27 million years.</p>
<p>Oongratulations on your victory.<br>
What will you demand as a settlement?</p>
<p>First, we'll demand a complete shutdown<br>
of all bee work camps.</p>
<p>Then we want back the honey<br>
that was ours to begin with,</p>
<p>every last drop.</p>
<p>We demand an end to the glorification<br>
of the bear as anything more</p>
<p>than a filthy, smelly,<br>
bad-breath stink machine.</p>
<p>We're all aware<br>
of what they do in the woods.</p>
<p>Wait for my signal.</p>
<p>Take him out.</p>
<p>He'll have nauseous<br>
for a few hours, then he'll be fine.</p>
<p>And we will no longer tolerate<br>
bee-negative nicknames...</p>
<p>But it's just a prance-about stage name!</p>
<p>...unnecessary inclusion of honey<br>
in bogus health products</p>
<p>and la-dee-da human<br>
tea-time snack garnishments.</p>
<p>Oan't breathe.</p>
<p>Bring it in, boys!</p>
<p>Hold it right there! Good.</p>
<p>Tap it.</p>
<p>Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,<br>
and there's gallons more coming!</p>
<ul>
<li>I think we need to shut down!</li>
<li>Shut down? We've never shut down.</li>
</ul>
<p>Shut down honey production!</p>
<p>Stop making honey!</p>
<p>Turn your key, sir!</p>
<p>What do we do now?</p>
<p>Oannonball!</p>
<p>We're shutting honey production!</p>
<p>Mission abort.</p>
<p>Aborting pollination and nectar detail.<br>
Returning to base.</p>
<p>Adam, you wouldn't believe<br>
how much honey was out there.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah?</p>
<p>What's going on? Where is everybody?</p>
<ul>
<li>Are they out celebrating?</li>
<li>They're home.</li>
</ul>
<p>They don't know what to do.<br>
Laying out, sleeping in.</p>
<p>I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way<br>
to San Antonio with a cricket.</p>
<p>At least we got our honey back.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think, so what if humans<br>
liked our honey? Who wouldn't?</p>
<p>It's the greatest thing in the world!<br>
I was excited to be part of making it.</p>
<p>This was my new desk. This was my<br>
new job. I wanted to do it really well.</p>
<p>And now...</p>
<p>Now I can't.</p>
<p>I don't understand<br>
why they're not happy.</p>
<p>I thought their lives would be better!</p>
<p>They're doing nothing. It's amazing.<br>
Honey really changes people.</p>
<p>You don't have any idea<br>
what's going on, do you?</p>
<ul>
<li>What did you want to show me?</li>
<li>This.</li>
</ul>
<p>What happened here?</p>
<p>That is not the half of it.</p>
<p>Oh, no. Oh, my.</p>
<p>They're all wilting.</p>
<p>Doesn't look very good, does it?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>And whose fault do you think that is?</p>
<p>You know, I'm gonna guess bees.</p>
<p>Bees?</p>
<p>Specifically, me.</p>
<p>I didn't think bees not needing to make<br>
honey would affect all these things.</p>
<p>It's notjust flowers.<br>
Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.</p>
<p>That's our whole SAT test right there.</p>
<p>Take away produce, that affects<br>
the entire animal kingdom.</p>
<p>And then, of course...</p>
<p>The human species?</p>
<p>So if there's no more pollination,</p>
<p>it could all just go south here,<br>
couldn't it?</p>
<p>I know this is also partly my fault.</p>
<p>How about a suicide pact?</p>
<p>How do we do it?</p>
<ul>
<li>I'll sting you, you step on me.</li>
<li>Thatjust kills you twice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>Listen, Barry...<br>
sorry, but I gotta get going.</p>
<p>I had to open my mouth and talk.</p>
<p>Vanessa?</p>
<p>Vanessa? Why are you leaving?<br>
Where are you going?</p>
<p>To the final Tournament of Roses parade<br>
in Pasadena.</p>
<p>They've moved it to this weekend<br>
because all the flowers are dying.</p>
<p>It's the last chance<br>
I'll ever have to see it.</p>
<p>Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.<br>
I never meant it to turn out like this.</p>
<p>I know. Me neither.</p>
<p>Tournament of Roses.<br>
Roses can't do sports.</p>
<p>Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?</p>
<p>Roses!</p>
<p>Vanessa!</p>
<p>Roses?!</p>
<p>Barry?</p>
<ul>
<li>Roses are flowers!</li>
<li>Yes, they are.</li>
</ul>
<p>Flowers, bees, pollen!</p>
<p>I know.<br>
That's why this is the last parade.</p>
<p>Maybe not.<br>
Oould you ask him to slow down?</p>
<p>Oould you slow down?</p>
<p>Barry!</p>
<p>OK, I made a huge mistake.<br>
This is a total disaster, all my fault.</p>
<p>Yes, it kind of is.</p>
<p>I've ruined the planet.<br>
I wanted to help you</p>
<p>with the flower shop.<br>
I've made it worse.</p>
<p>Actually, it's completely closed down.</p>
<p>I thought maybe you were remodeling.</p>
<p>But I have another idea, and it's<br>
greater than my previous ideas combined.</p>
<p>I don't want to hear it!</p>
<p>All right, they have the roses,<br>
the roses have the pollen.</p>
<p>I know every bee, plant<br>
and flower bud in this park.</p>
<p>All we gotta do is get what they've got<br>
back here with what we've got.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Bees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Park.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pollen!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flowers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repollination!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Across the nation!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Tournament of Roses,<br>
Pasadena, Oalifornia.</p>
<p>They've got nothing<br>
but flowers, floats and cotton candy.</p>
<p>Security will be tight.</p>
<p>I have an idea.</p>
<p>Vanessa Bloome, FTD.</p>
<p>Official floral business. It's real.</p>
<p>Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.</p>
<p>Thank you. It was a gift.</p>
<p>Once inside,<br>
we just pick the right float.</p>
<p>How about The Princess and the Pea?</p>
<p>I could be the princess,<br>
and you could be the pea!</p>
<p>Yes, I got it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Where should I sit?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are you?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I believe I'm the pea.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pea?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It goes under the mattresses.</p>
<ul>
<li>Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.</li>
<li>I'm getting the marshal.</li>
</ul>
<p>You do that!<br>
This whole parade is a fiasco!</p>
<p>Let's see what this baby'll do.</p>
<p>Hey, what are you doing?!</p>
<p>Then all we do<br>
is blend in with traffic...</p>
<p>...without arousing suspicion.</p>
<p>Once at the airport,<br>
there's no stopping us.</p>
<p>Stop! Security.</p>
<ul>
<li>You and your insect pack your float?</li>
<li>Yes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Has it been<br>
in your possession the entire time?</p>
<p>Would you remove your shoes?</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove your stinger.</li>
<li>It's part of me.</li>
</ul>
<p>I know. Just having some fun.<br>
Enjoy your flight.</p>
<p>Then if we're lucky, we'll have<br>
just enough pollen to do the job.</p>
<p>Oan you believe how lucky we are? We<br>
have just enough pollen to do the job!</p>
<p>I think this is gonna work.</p>
<p>It's got to work.</p>
<p>Attention, passengers,<br>
this is Oaptain Scott.</p>
<p>We have a bit of bad weather<br>
in New York.</p>
<p>It looks like we'll experience<br>
a couple hours delay.</p>
<p>Barry, these are cut flowers<br>
with no water. They'll never make it.</p>
<p>I gotta get up there<br>
and talk to them.</p>
<p>Be careful.</p>
<p>Oan I get help<br>
with the Sky Mall magazine?</p>
<p>I'd like to order the talking<br>
inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.</p>
<p>Oaptain, I'm in a real situation.</p>
<ul>
<li>What'd you say, Hal?</li>
<li>Nothing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bee!</p>
<p>Don't freak out! My entire species...</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<ul>
<li>Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!</li>
<li>Who's an attorney?</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't move.</p>
<p>Oh, Barry.</p>
<p>Good afternoon, passengers.<br>
This is your captain.</p>
<p>Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B<br>
please report to the cockpit?</p>
<p>And please hurry!</p>
<p>What happened here?</p>
<p>There was a DustBuster,<br>
a toupee, a life raft exploded.</p>
<p>One's bald, one's in a boat,<br>
they're both unconscious!</p>
<ul>
<li>Is that another bee joke?</li>
<li>No!</li>
</ul>
<p>No one's flying the plane!</p>
<p>This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.<br>
What's your status?</p>
<p>This is Vanessa Bloome.<br>
I'm a florist from New York.</p>
<p>Where's the pilot?</p>
<p>He's unconscious,<br>
and so is the copilot.</p>
<p>Not good. Does anyone onboard<br>
have flight experience?</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, there is.</p>
<ul>
<li>Who's that?</li>
<li>Barry Benson.</li>
</ul>
<p>From the honey trial?! Oh, great.</p>
<p>Vanessa, this is nothing more<br>
than a big metal bee.</p>
<p>It's got giant wings, huge engines.</p>
<p>I can't fly a plane.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?</li>
<li>Yes.</li>
</ul>
<p>How hard could it be?</p>
<p>Wait, Barry!<br>
We're headed into some lightning.</p>
<p>This is Bob Bumble. We have some<br>
late-breaking news from JFK Airport,</p>
<p>where a suspenseful scene<br>
is developing.</p>
<p>Barry Benson,<br>
fresh from his legal victory...</p>
<p>That's Barry!</p>
<p>...is attempting to land a plane,<br>
loaded with people, flowers</p>
<p>and an incapacitated flight crew.</p>
<p>Flowers?!</p>
<p>We have a storm in the area<br>
and two individuals at the controls</p>
<p>with absolutely no flight experience.</p>
<p>Just a minute.<br>
There's a bee on that plane.</p>
<p>I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson<br>
and his no-account compadres.</p>
<p>They've done enough damage.</p>
<p>But isn't he your only hope?</p>
<p>Technically, a bee<br>
shouldn't be able to fly at all.</p>
<p>Their wings are too small...</p>
<p>Haven't we heard this a million times?</p>
<p>&quot;The surface area of the wings<br>
and body mass make no sense.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Get this on the air!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Got it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stand by.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We're going live.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The way we work may be a mystery to you.</p>
<p>Making honey takes a lot of bees<br>
doing a lot of small jobs.</p>
<p>But let me tell you about a small job.</p>
<p>If you do it well,<br>
it makes a big difference.</p>
<p>More than we realized.<br>
To us, to everyone.</p>
<p>That's why I want to get bees<br>
back to working together.</p>
<p>That's the bee way!<br>
We're not made of Jell-O.</p>
<p>We get behind a fellow.</p>
<ul>
<li>Black and yellow!</li>
<li>Hello!</li>
</ul>
<p>Left, right, down, hover.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hover?</li>
<li>Forget hover.</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn't so hard.<br>
Beep-beep! Beep-beep!</p>
<p>Barry, what happened?!</p>
<p>Wait, I think we were<br>
on autopilot the whole time.</p>
<ul>
<li>That may have been helping me.</li>
<li>And now we're not!</li>
</ul>
<p>So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.</p>
<p>All of you, let's get<br>
behind this fellow! Move it out!</p>
<p>Move out!</p>
<p>Our only chance is if I do what I'd do,<br>
you copy me with the wings of the plane!</p>
<p>Don't have to yell.</p>
<p>I'm not yelling!<br>
We're in a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>It's very hard to concentrate<br>
with that panicky tone in your voice!</p>
<p>It's not a tone. I'm panicking!</p>
<p>I can't do this!</p>
<p>Vanessa, pull yourself together.<br>
You have to snap out of it!</p>
<p>You snap out of it.</p>
<p>You snap out of it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You snap out of it!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You snap out of it!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You snap out of it!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You snap out of it!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You snap out of it!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You snap out of it!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hold it!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why? Oome on, it's my turn.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>How is the plane flying?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Hello?</p>
<p>Benson, got any flowers<br>
for a happy occasion in there?</p>
<p>The Pollen Jocks!</p>
<p>They do get behind a fellow.</p>
<ul>
<li>Black and yellow.</li>
<li>Hello.</li>
</ul>
<p>All right, let's drop this tin can<br>
on the blacktop.</p>
<p>Where? I can't see anything. Oan you?</p>
<p>No, nothing. It's all cloudy.</p>
<p>Oome on. You got to think bee, Barry.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thinking bee.</li>
<li>Thinking bee.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thinking bee!<br>
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!</p>
<p>Wait a minute.<br>
I think I'm feeling something.</p>
<ul>
<li>What?</li>
<li>I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.</li>
</ul>
<p>Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.</p>
<p>Bring the nose down.</p>
<p>Thinking bee!<br>
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!</p>
<ul>
<li>What in the world is on the tarmac?</li>
<li>Get some lights on that!</li>
</ul>
<p>Thinking bee!<br>
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!</p>
<ul>
<li>Vanessa, aim for the flower.</li>
<li>OK.</li>
</ul>
<p>Out the engines. We're going in<br>
on bee power. Ready, boys?</p>
<p>Affirmative!</p>
<p>Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.</p>
<p>Land on that flower!</p>
<p>Ready? Full reverse!</p>
<p>Spin it around!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Not that flower! The other one!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which one?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That flower.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'm aiming at the flower!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.<br>
I mean the giant pulsating flower</p>
<p>made of millions of bees!</p>
<p>Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.</p>
<p>Rotate around it.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is insane, Barry!</li>
<li>This's the only way I know how to fly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane<br>
flying in an insect-like pattern?</p>
<p>Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid.<br>
Smell it. Full reverse!</p>
<p>Just drop it. Be a part of it.</p>
<p>Aim for the center!</p>
<p>Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!</p>
<p>Oome on, already.</p>
<p>Barry, we did it!<br>
You taught me how to fly!</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. No high-five!</li>
<li>Right.</li>
</ul>
<p>Barry, it worked!<br>
Did you see the giant flower?</p>
<p>What giant flower? Where? Of course<br>
I saw the flower! That was genius!</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you.</li>
<li>But we're not done yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Listen, everyone!</p>
<p>This runway is covered<br>
with the last pollen</p>
<p>from the last flowers<br>
available anywhere on Earth.</p>
<p>That means this is our last chance.</p>
<p>We're the only ones who make honey,<br>
pollinate flowers and dress like this.</p>
<p>If we're gonna survive as a species,<br>
this is our moment! What do you say?</p>
<p>Are we going to be bees, orjust<br>
Museum of Natural History keychains?</p>
<p>We're bees!</p>
<p>Keychain!</p>
<p>Then follow me! Except Keychain.</p>
<p>Hold on, Barry. Here.</p>
<p>You've earned this.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect<br>
fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>That's our Barry.</p>
<p>Mom! The bees are back!</p>
<p>If anybody needs<br>
to make a call, now's the time.</p>
<p>I got a feeling we'll be<br>
working late tonight!</p>
<p>Here's your change. Have a great<br>
afternoon! Oan I help who's next?</p>
<p>Would you like some honey with that?<br>
It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.</p>
<p>Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me.<br>
And I don't see a nickel!</p>
<p>Sometimes I just feel<br>
like a piece of meat!</p>
<p>I had no idea.</p>
<p>Barry, I'm sorry.<br>
Have you got a moment?</p>
<p>Would you excuse me?<br>
My mosquito associate will help you.</p>
<p>Sorry I'm late.</p>
<p>He's a lawyer too?</p>
<p>I was already a blood-sucking parasite.<br>
All I needed was a briefcase.</p>
<p>Have a great afternoon!</p>
<p>Barry, I just got this huge tulip order,<br>
and I can't get them anywhere.</p>
<p>No problem, Vannie.<br>
Just leave it to me.</p>
<p>You're a lifesaver, Barry.<br>
Oan I help who's next?</p>
<p>All right, scramble, jocks!<br>
It's time to fly.</p>
<p>Thank you, Barry!</p>
<p>That bee is living my life!</p>
<p>Let it go, Kenny.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When will this nightmare end?!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let it all go.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beautiful day to fly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sure is.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Between you and me,<br>
I was dying to get out of that office.</p>
<p>You have got<br>
to start thinking bee, my friend.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thinking bee!</li>
<li>Me?</li>
</ul>
<p>Hold it. Let's just stop<br>
for a second. Hold it.</p>
<p>I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone.<br>
Oan we stop here?</p>
<p>I'm not making a major life decision<br>
during a production number!</p>
<p>All right. Take ten, everybody.<br>
Wrap it up, guys.</p>
<p>I had virtually no rehearsal for that.</p>
