### lots of things to work on!!

- [ ] styling
- [ ] make the center pane resizing work (have a default height for the bottom that still allow full resizing functionality)
- [ ] make the "notes" (right) side bar templates
- [ ] do we want some cute lil icon in the title?
- [ ] are the paths correct for our stylesheets and scripts? (`/../../` seems kinda weird but idk)
- [ ] figure out how padding works with these weird table cell things
- [ ] how do we want to organize/categorize/tag our content?
- [ ] probably going to have to figure out scrolling with the side bars? alos figure out weird overflow issues??
- [ ] can the `last_modified` metadata attribute be updated programmatically?
- [ ] make it accessible
- [ ] make it mobile-friendly
